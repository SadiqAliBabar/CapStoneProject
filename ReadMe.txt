Human Action Recognition (HAR) Project
This project focuses on recognizing human actions in videos using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

Features
- Video Processing: Converts input videos into frames for analysis.
- Action Recognition: Predicts actions in the video frames using a trained model.
- Output Generation: Saves the predicted results into a processed video.
